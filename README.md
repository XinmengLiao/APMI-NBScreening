**NBScreening** is the WGS-based newborn screening project of Anatolian Precision Medicine Initiative. It represents the first newborn sequencing initiative in TÃ¼rkiye. We demonstrated the feasibility of integrating the distinct Turkish genetic landscape with established newborn sequencing strategies by highlighting Familial Mediterranean Fever (_MEFV_) as the most prevalent screen-positive monogenic neonatal rare disease among 1,100 Turkish newborns in our pilot study. The sequencing screening pipeline has been rigorously refined and validated via simulating newborn screening on data from the UK Biobank cohort and in-house Turkish healthy adult datasets.


**NBScreening** shows promise as a robust second-tier strategy, complementing conventional newborn screening methods and enhancing national neonatal health outcomes.
